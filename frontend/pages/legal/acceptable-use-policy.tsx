      <p>
        We may, in some cases, give you a warning and/or remove the infringing
        Contribution, however, if your breach is serious or if you continue to
        breach our Legal Terms and this Policy, we have the right to suspend or

        Guideline violations will result in posting access being restricted by
        first being flagged for moderation. This will require a moderator to
        approve a user's post. This restriction is meant to be temporary, and
        will be lifted when the moderators see the situation has been resolved.
        If a user cannot follow the guidelines after that, their account will be
        blocked from posting. Further actions (such as restricting access to the
        Services as a whole) can and will be applied if necessary.
